00:03:53    Morgan Grovenburg:  I saw the book mentioned a DataEdu Slack Channel (https://dataedu.slack.com/). Is that still going/active?

00:05:10    Jon Harmon (jonthegeek):    Yes it is! It's not as active as R4DS, but there are usually discussions happening.

00:05:10    Isabella Vel√°squez:    Hey Morgan! That‚Äôs is actually where the book got started :) There are lots of people on that Slack. I can send an invite link to join if anybody is interested.

00:05:36    Morgan Grovenburg:  Yes I'm interested in an invite!

00:05:40    Rob Lucas:  Me too!

00:06:12    Isabella Vel√°squez:    Here it is! Let‚Äôs work together in Slack! It‚Äôs a faster, simpler way to talk shop, share files, and get work done. Join here: https://join.slack.com/t/dataedu/shared_invite/zt-9jkexbww-QxFbexhFoanFicVWaEpyBA

00:16:55    beth.kelly: I prefer the camera too! Sorry.

00:18:23    Isabella Vel√°squez:    Thanks Beth! Same here, I often feel siloed and I can‚Äôt wait to learn from all your work.

00:21:10    Jon Harmon (jonthegeek):    r4ds.io/diseur will take you to the bookdown side of the repo, and allow you to hop over to the GitHub (assuming I set it up correctly)

00:22:04    Layla Bouzoubaa:    John I get a 404

00:22:15    Alyssa Ibarra:  Same here

00:22:47    Ryan Woodbury:  https://github.com/r4ds/bookclub-dsieur

00:23:19    Jon Harmon (jonthegeek):    Hmmm. Evidently it requires https://r4ds.io/dsieur

00:23:35    Jon Harmon (jonthegeek):    ...which might have just solved a bug I've had elsewhere.

00:24:04    Layla Bouzoubaa:    sweeet

00:28:08    beth.kelly: Jon is freezing for everyone else, right?

00:28:12    Morgan Grovenburg:  Yes

00:28:12    Alyssa Ibarra:  I think you‚Äôre freezing, Jon

00:28:17    Daniel Jin: Y

00:28:51    Mark LaVenia:   https://github.com/r4ds/bookclub-dsieur

00:29:52    Daniel Jin: 50% this time tho!

00:30:16    Jon Harmon (jonthegeek):    I will talk about this on the Slack evidently üôÉ

00:30:28    Isabella Vel√°squez:    yeah absolutely. Can‚Äôt wait to get any feedback!!

00:33:12    Jon Harmon (jonthegeek):    My internet is really bad today, gonna drop off!

00:33:28    Ryan Woodbury:  Thanks for setting this up! See you soon.

00:37:28    Isabella Vel√°squez:    Yes! And we‚Äôll send a Slack message once we‚Äôre done.

00:39:46    Ryan Woodbury:  I listened to a podcast about the Kentucky stats project. It sounded way cool!

00:41:44    beth.kelly: That's great! I'd love to hear about the podcast.

00:42:19    beth.kelly: I love the desks in your background Rob!

00:43:14    Rob Lucas:  Thanks, Beth! They came out of a school in Ohio where my grandfather was a principal.

00:43:28    Isabella Vel√°squez:    So glad to hear it!!

00:46:12    Michael H:  Ryan E‚Äôs podcast About Practice is great

00:46:39    Ryan Woodbury:  ^^ Yes ^^

00:49:38    beth.kelly: So interested in retention in higher ed!

00:51:28    Ryan Woodbury:  Here is the podcast link the ‚ÄúData Ed Chat‚Äù, episode 10 discusses the Kentucky Stats Explorer: https://www.buzzsprout.com/1074286

00:51:45    Ryan Woodbury:  And the ‚ÄúAbout Practice‚Äù podcast with two of the books authors: https://anchor.fm/about-practice/episodes/1-Hypothesis-Testing-for-Kids-is-Basically-Torture-eq0qc6

00:53:48    Morgan Grovenburg:  I think that was everyone

00:54:30    Mark LaVenia:   Thank you! :)

00:54:55    Daniel Jin: Thank you Ryan and Isabella for organizing! Can't wait!

00:55:00    Mark LaVenia:   I'll stick around for that too :)

00:55:13    Marina: This is my first time participating in something like this. Usually, how long do these sessions last?

00:56:01    Ryan Woodbury:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d41oc2OMAuI&feature=youtu.be

00:56:49    Ryan Woodbury:  The sessions are blocked for an hour. However, I have seen some videos from other book clubs that last for 30 minutes. It‚Äôll depend on the week.

00:57:31    Marina: Ok, thanks!

01:08:02    Mark LaVenia:   very helpful. thanks!

00:42:20	Ryan Woodbury:	same
00:42:27	Marina:	^^^
00:56:18	Marina:	I know this is an R-focused thing, but for basic/quick spatial analysis, I've really enjoyed using QGIS, which is more point and click
00:57:41	Mark LaVenia:	thanks @Marina. Really trying to stretch into R and Python. Thanks for the tip on QGIS; will check that out
01:02:57	Mark LaVenia:	+1

00:11:02	Catherine Miller:	thank you!
00:25:22	Catherine Miller:	5 levels, maybe? instructors, aides, administrators, executives, data folks
00:26:17	Rob Lucas (he/him):	5 seems about right, depending where you divide them up
00:27:02	Yukie Toyama:	Yeah 5 groups: researchers, funding organization, teachers, students, and parents/public
00:27:04	Isabella Vel√°squez:	We cut across different strategies on our team. Top ones are leadership, non-technical team members, technical team members, external partners
00:27:37	Catherine Miller:	the technical and non-technical categories are useful for this
00:28:00	Catherine Miller:	plus external partners who see a different grain size of data
00:28:19	Mark LaVenia:	We have an Executive Director, Chiefs, Directors, Specialists, and Managers--and my work requires working across and between all levels
00:28:47	Isabella Vel√°squez:	yes. data privacy concerns are really important when considering what data is being shared
00:28:53	Catherine Miller:	Thinking in Systems is also useful? Donella Meadows

00:06:21    Layla Bouzoubaa:    Hello everyone
00:06:47    Catherine Miller:   Hello!
00:07:29    Mark LaVenia:   Hi everyone
00:13:40    Ronak Patel:    3 minutes in and I've already learned something new!
00:13:51    Daniel Jin: +1
00:13:51    Morgan Grovenburg:  Me too!
00:14:53    Ryan Woodbury:  It looks way better in the book down compared to Google Slides
00:14:56    Carlo M:    reproducibility
00:16:17    Catherine Miller:   thanks, that was helpful
00:17:25    Mike Haugen:    The R markdown chapter in R4DS goes over benefits: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html
00:22:30    shamsuddeen:    New approach for installing packages: https://github.com/r-lib/pak
00:26:20    Ryan Woodbury:  YES!!! I just used it!
00:26:36    Carlo M:    Syntactic sugar of ifelse(is.na(certification), certification_1, certification)
00:27:04    Marina: ^^ yeah, I had been using ifelse, but this looks neater
00:27:05    Ryan Woodbury:  Trying to combine cohort data where each cohort has different variable names.
00:30:42    Alyssa Ibarra:  According to Help, coalesce is from dplyr
00:30:55    Layla Bouzoubaa:    janitor
00:30:59    shamsuddeen:    coalesce is from dplyr?
00:31:09    Layla Bouzoubaa:    janitor::remove_empty()
00:31:14    shamsuddeen:    Oh yah, I see it
00:31:25    Carlo M:    Yup, coalesce is dplyr
00:37:22    Layla Bouzoubaa:    If you do in the ?stats::filter console, it is for time series data
00:37:32    Layla Bouzoubaa:    He‚Äôs correct
00:37:43    Alyssa Ibarra:  Thanks for that clarification!
00:39:55    Morgan Grovenburg:  Always <-
00:40:00    Mike Haugen:    ^^
00:40:14    Ronak Patel:    -> gives me anxiety
00:40:28    Carlo M:    When I get lazy, I end up using `->`
00:40:43    Morgan Grovenburg:  My reason is to keep = straight
00:40:48    Isabella Vel√°squez:    same! I only use -> when I don‚Äôt want to scroll all the way to the beginning of a pipe XD
00:40:54    Layla Bouzoubaa:    Second Ronan‚Äôs point
00:41:01    Layla Bouzoubaa:    ronak*
00:42:53    Isabella Vel√°squez:    I once spent a lot of time before realizing I used ‚Äò instead of `
00:46:40    Carlo M:    Morgan is right. The {stats} library would get masked when library(dplyr) is called
00:50:07    shamsuddeen:    Happy Git with R is a good book on learning Gihub: https://happygitwithr.com
00:52:56    Layla Bouzoubaa:    Sorry everyone I need to hop off. Cheers!
00:53:01    Mike Haugen:    How do you get a branch?
00:54:53    Alyssa Ibarra:  ^ same question
00:56:29    Catherine Miller:   Thank you Mark :)
00:56:31    Marina: This discussion is giving me scary git flashbacks
00:56:39    Catherine Miller:   githell, right?
00:57:20    Marina: ^^^
00:58:53    Carlo M:    You‚Äôre doing great!!
00:59:16    Catherine Miller:   I always get lost here, too.
01:02:06    Isabella Vel√°squez:    I always create a branch by clicking the button next to main in R Studio
01:03:48    Ronak Patel:    I gotta hop off for another meeting. Thanks, Mark. Great job today! See ya'll next week.
01:03:49    Catherine Miller:   Thank you!!
01:04:18    Catherine Miller:   Thank you for being brave and helping us learn, Mark!!
01:04:20    shamsuddeen:    Thanks
01:04:24    Alyssa Ibarra:  Thank you!
01:04:37    Carlo M:    Thanks Mark!
